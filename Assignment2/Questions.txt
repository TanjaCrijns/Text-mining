4. Section 3.3.1:
“An important step in bootstrapping methods is to evaluate the quality of extraction patterns so as not to include many noisy patterns during the extraction process.
For example, from the seed entity pair ⟨Google,Mountain View⟩ we may also find “Google, Mountain View” in the corpus. However, the pattern
“ORG, LOC” is not a reliable one and thus should not be used.”

Why is “ORG, LOC” not a reliable pattern?
